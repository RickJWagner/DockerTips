# You can tar up a product installation, then copy it (in a dockerfile) to an image.  Later, you can 'run -i -t' to get a command prompt in the container, you can start the server there.

Example:

FROM java:7
RUN mkdir -p opt/jboss/FSW
COPY  FSW_RU5.tar.gz /opt/jboss/FSW/FSW_RU5.tar.gz
RUN chmod 777 /opt/jboss/FSW
RUN chmod 777 /opt/jboss/FSW/FSW_RU5.tar.gz
RUN gunzip /opt/jboss/FSW/FSW_RU5.tar.gz


# Now you can 'docker cp' your applications from the docker host to the /standalone/deployments directory for quick deploy.  You can also 'docker cp' docker's FSW log to your host for viewing.
