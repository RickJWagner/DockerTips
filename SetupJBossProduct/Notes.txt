# You can tar up a product installation, then copy it (in a dockerfile) to an image.  Later, you can 'run -i -t' to get a command prompt in the container, you can start the server there.

Example:

FROM java:7
RUN mkdir -p opt/jboss/FSW
COPY  FSW_RU5.tar.gz /opt/jboss/FSW/FSW_RU5.tar.gz
RUN chmod 777 /opt/jboss/FSW
RUN chmod 777 /opt/jboss/FSW/FSW_RU5.tar.gz
RUN gunzip /opt/jboss/FSW/FSW_RU5.tar.gz


# Now you can 'docker cp' your applications from the docker host to the /standalone/deployments directory for quick deploy.  You can also 'docker cp' docker's FSW log to your host for viewing.


Start your container, with ports exposed:
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -p 9990:9990 fsw_ru5 /bin/bash

Before starting the product, use add-user.sh to get a console user.  Then remember to bind to all interfaces:
./standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0 -bmanagement 0.0.0.0
